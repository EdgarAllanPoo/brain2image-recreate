# brain2image-recreate
Recreating the experiment from the paper "Brain2Image: Converting Brain Signals into Images" by Kasavidis, Palazzo, Spampinato, and Giordano. The paper works consist of creating a deeplearning framework consisting of an LSTM stacked with a generative method, which learns a more compact and noise-free representation of EEG data and employs it to generate the visual stimuli evoking specific brain responses.
