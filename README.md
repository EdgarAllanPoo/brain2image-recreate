# ThoughtViz-recreate
Recreating the experiment from the paper "ThoughtViz: Visualizing Human Thoughts Using Generative
Adversarial Network" by Tirupattur, Rawat, Spampinato, and Shah. The paper works consist of creating a deeplearning framework which leverage the recent progress of adversarial learning by devising a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which takes, as input, encoded EEG signals andgenerates corresponding images.
